Chromalog's documentation
=========================

Chromalog is a Python library that eases the use of
colors in Python logging.

It integrates seamlessly into any Python 2 or Python 3 project. Based on
`colorama <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama>`_, it works on both Windows
and \*NIX platforms and is highly configurable.

Chromalog can detect whether the associated output stream is color-capable and
even has a fallback mechanism: if color is not supported, your log will look no
worse than it was before you colorized it.

Using **Chromalog**, getting a logging-system that looks like this is a breeze:

Its use is simple and straightforward:

.. testsetup::

   from logging import getLogger
   logger = getLogger()
   username = 'user'

.. testcode::

   from chromalog.mark.helpers.simple import important

   logger.info("Connected as %s for 2 hours.", important(username))
